This plugin is written for integrating AppDynamics with Jenkins.

== To be open-sourced when first stable version is reached ==

AppDynamics provides detailed information about any application and this data can be queried via the REST
interface. This plugin tries to fetch the information related to a build, e.g. after running JMeter, and
visualizes it within Jenkins.

Many thanks to the developers of the Jenkins Performance plugin
 <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Performance+Plugin>,
on which this plugins is largely based.
